### Purpose:
The purpose of the task management project is to create a simple yet effective tool that allows users to manage their tasks conveniently. Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, delete tasks, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. This type of application is useful for individuals seeking to improve their productivity and keep track of their tasks in a structured way.

### Features:
- **Add Tasks:** Users can create new tasks and add them to their task list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks in place by replacing the task text with an input field and saving the changes.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list, which also updates local storage accordingly.
- **Toggle Completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete using checkboxes, allowing for visual tracking of progress.
- **Persistent Storage:** The application uses local storage to save the tasks, ensuring that the information is retained even after the page is refreshed.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is simple and straightforward, allowing users to manage their tasks with minimal friction.

  ## Technology Used:
- **HTML:** For structuring the user interface components such as input fields, buttons, and task lists.
- **CSS:** For styling the application, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the core functionality of the application, including handling user interactions and manipulating the DOM to display tasks.
- **Local Storage:** To store tasks persistently in the userâ€™s browser, allowing data to be retained even after page refreshes.
